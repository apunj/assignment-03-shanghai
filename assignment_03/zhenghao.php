	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>I identify myself as the enemy of racism, sexualism, and anti-LGBT groups, and I strongly oppose any discrimination in every single possible form. There is no exception. Fascinated by Japanese culture, I learned Japanese in the past 4 years. If possible, I wish I could live there for several years. I definitely love Japanese cuisines like ramen but resist raw seafood. At school, I learned ACC201(Financial Accounting), ACC221(Managerial Accounting), FIN205(Financial Management), FIN206(Investment), FIN242(International Finance), MTH210(Financial Mathematics), ECO230(Economic(Statistics), ECO231(Econometrics), CSC172(Data Structures and Algorithms), etc. I have completed the Certificate Program in Mathematical Modeling in Political Science and Economics here at the University of Rochester. In addition, I have enrolled in a number of programs including the CFA Program (Level 2 Candidate) and the FRM Program (All levels passed).</p>

	<h3>Hobbies</h3>
	<p>I have a crazily-inclusive hobby list, which includes but not limited to music, game, travelling and photographing. I enjoy music as a layman, and I have a super-inclusive music list, including symphonies, jazz, blues, rock, electronic, J-pop, etc. But no country music! I’m a professional(self-reported) connoisseur of milk tea. The unofficial spokesperson(again self-reported) for a Taiwanese milk tea brand called “Yi Dian Dian.” Seriously, they should consider officially hiring me as their marketing representative, because I bought countless drinks and advertised for them a lot.</p>
