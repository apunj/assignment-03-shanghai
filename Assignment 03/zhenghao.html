<h2>Financial Economics Major, class of 2018</h2>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I identify myself as the enemy of racism, sexualism, and anti-LGBT groups, and I strongly oppose any discrimination in every single possible form. There is no exception. Fascinated by Japanese culture, I learned Japanese in the past 4 years. If possible, I wish I could live there for several years. I definitely love Japanese cuisines like ramen but resist raw seafood. At school, I learned ACC201(Financial Accounting), ACC221(Managerial Accounting), FIN205(Financial Management), FIN206(Investment), FIN242(International Finance), MTH210(Financial Mathematics), ECO230(Economic(Statistics), ECO231(Econometrics), CSC172(Data Structures and Algorithms), etc. I have completed the Certificate Program in Mathematical Modeling in Political Science and Economics here at the University of Rochester. In addition, I have enrolled in a number of programs including the CFA Program (Level 2 Candidate) and the FRM Program (All levels passed).</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>I have a crazily-inclusive hobby list, which includes but not limited to music, game, travelling and photographing. I enjoy music as a layman, and I have a super-inclusive music list, including symphonies, jazz, blues, rock, electronic, J-pop, etc. But no country music! I’m a professional(self-reported) connoisseur of milk tea. The unofficial spokesperson(again self-reported) for a Taiwanese milk tea brand called “Yi Dian Dian.” Seriously, they should consider officially hiring me as their marketing representative, because I bought countless drinks and advertised for them a lot.</p>

<h3>Other Information</h3>
<p>Considering work and internship experience, I designed python, SQL and SAS programs to conduct data analysis, auto-classify funds by category, analyze attribution, generate report, calculate maximum drop down, and update performance ranking, working on excel for daily reporting purpose. In addition, I collected request from senior analysts and cooperated with IT section to realize desired functionsWorking with senior employers, I researched and examined bill risk and credit risk among branches within the province and assisted a round of Securitization of Non-Performing Assets. I visited real assets in various locations and collecting information necessary for pricing analysis, checked and improved manual records of bad debts, facilitating packing, verification and cancellation. Also, I worked under the Section of Foreign Debt and Foreign Investment, helped legal people of local firms with business profiles and reporting paperwork written in English, contacted companies and counterparty commercial banks to ensure compliance with regulations of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.</p>
